Overview

  Multiple CPUs are increasingly used to parallelise tasks that
  require a high computation time. In fact, parallel optimisation
  algorithms are widely present in the literature. On the other hand,
  hydraulic simulators that support parallel computation are
  scarce. The most popular research simulator, EPANET [1], was not
  designed with concurrency in mind. We are currently developing a new
  thread-safe variant of the EPANET Toolkit that can be used in
  parallel applications based on our own modified version of the
  EPANET Toolkit [2].

  More information about the development of this thread-safe version
  of EPANET and its potential applications is available in the
  following paper:

    Optimisation Of Pump Schedules With A Thread-Safe Variant Of
    EPANET Toolkit. In Proceedings of the 10th Annual
    Water Distribution Systems Analysis Conference WDSA2008. Van
    Zyl, J.E., Ilemobade, A.A., Jacobs, H.E. (eds.), August 17-20,
    2008, Kruger National Park, South Africa.

  Please, be aware that this is EXPERIMENTAL software. Not all
  functionality of the original EPANET Toolkit is available.

Using the EPANET Toolkit in your program

  Building successfully a program which uses the EPANET library
  requires that the compiler is able to find the header file
  toolkit.h and the library file libtoolkit.a . The first step is
  accomplished by adding the line #include "toolkit.h" to your header
  file (e.g. yourprogram.h ).  You also need to compile your program
  using the option -Idir where dir is the directory of
  toolkit.h. (The option -Idir is not needed if toolkit.h is in the
  current directory.) You may also need to indicate to GCC that it
  should link with the mathematical library using the option
  -lm. For example:

$ gcc -I./toolkithdir/ -o yourprogram yourprogram.c libtoolkit.a -lm

  In old versions of GCC you may need to use the options -L and -l to
  link with libtoolkit.a . Consult the manual page of GCC for
  details.


Building the EPANET Toolkit from source

  The following command will build the library and place the
  resulting files libtoolkit.a and toolkit.h in the parent directory:

$ make toolkit

  Please check the file Makefile for more information about building
  the library.
